# Writing Feedback Session (**English only**)

Welcome! This open space is for everyone who wants to improve writing skills through writing workshop, tutoring, and consultation.

---------------------

### Description:
This Github repository is aimed to *assist your writing exercises and activites*.

Once you submit your essay, *comprehensive feedback* will be made. Beyond simply pointing out some errors on grammar or vocabulary, writing workshop will be made and offer feedbacks on whether you understand the problem or whether your essay is well-organized. You could also ask for the further consultation on your writings.

Through this open space, we will not only read and write together, share our thoughts with each other, improve our writing skills, but also further deepen the breadth and depth of our thoughts.

We will be learning from each other as this space provides ample space for communication and individual's development. Discussion, collaboration, engagement, and workshopping are strongly encouraged in that those are an essential part of this cooperative process.
